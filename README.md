# What
- lotrx is supposed to be a soft clone of the Lords of the realm 2 RTS battles. The soft part implies that the technological limitations will be removed, additional features will be added, the combat between units will be different
- the basic idea is to reacapture the spirit of the game

# Current status
- The default map is a woods map, where you can fight enemy units.
	- command groups work
	- baiting enemy units wont work, since they return to their initial position
- the game currently has a couple of catle maps, based on real castles, none of them are functional, per say. You could place enemy units inside and then storm the castle, break the doors, but there is no functional AI to defend it

# To Do
- waypoints
- adding additional units to command groups
- AI:
	- defending open map (being worked on)
	- attacking open map
	- defending castle
	- attacking castle
- a new UI to open and close castle doors, for more granular control, and possibility of sneek attaks
- siedge weapons
- damage difference depending on the angle of attack (if you get hit in the back, auch)
	- arrows deal more damage the closer they are shot at a target
	- castle walls give extra range
- a campaign
- LAN multiplayer

# Goal
- multiple campaign, trough which you could explore parts of history and real castles.
- multiple castle maps, based on real life castles
- skirmishes, where you can choose to fight an AI in a specific scenario
- AI tiers
- LAN multiplayer
	- LAM multiplayer COOP

The main goal is basically LAN multiplayer, but since I think it will be the hardest part, the idea is to make a playable product beforehand.
